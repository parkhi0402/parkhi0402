## Abstract ðŸ‘‹
The **Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA)** represents a landmark U.S. policy, investing $369 billion in energy security and climate change programs to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This study conducts a comparative sentiment analysis of public and private sector reactions to the IRA, focusing on the distinct emphases and framings these sectors bring to their evaluations. Using textual data collected from government agencies and private corporations, cleaned and analyzed with lexical tools and sentiment metrics, this research reveals notable differences in focus and sentiment.
